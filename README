Welcome to TravelCompanion in Scala / Lift.

This project was created during the bachelor thesis by Ralf Muri and Daniel Hobi in spring 2010.

The following technical aspects are implemented:
- JPA (based on lift-jpa-archetype)
- User Management (copy & paste from ProtoUser without mapper functionality)
- Validating (JSR 303)
- GUI Widgets (DistanceTraveler)
- Ajax & Comet (Blog as Single Page Application)
- REST
- Designer Friendly Templates
